## NZQA Scholarship Technologoy - Top Scholar Project
Scholarship assessment is the highest level of assessment in the New Zealand secondary school curriculum, available as a step above NCEA Level 3 for high achieving students. The technology scholarship assessment consists of students completing a technological outcome with social impact, working with a wide range of end users and stakeholders and writing a considered and justified reflection portfolio. Technology scholarship in 2022 was only rewarded to 1.6% of the Year 13 cohort taking Technology as an NCEA subject.

The project I submitted - SUBlime Substituion Manager - received the highest mark in the scholarship technology assessment earning me the Top Scholar award for Technology. This placed me 1st nationally for the subject of Technology. The Top Scholar award was presented to me by the Prime Minister at the NZQA Scholarship Awards Ceremony in Wellington. 

The written portfolio and project code is included in the repo. I have also included a document with tips for prospective scholarship technology students in this repo.
